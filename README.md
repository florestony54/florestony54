## Hi there, I'm Tony ðŸ‘‹ 
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-d-flores/) [Medium](https://medium.com/@florestony5454)


I'm a student at the University of Illinois Springfield pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science focusing on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I studied Biology and Chemistry in undergrad, and I generally love all things Science and Tech! ðŸ§ªðŸ’»

## What am I currently working on?
[Kaggle- Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000): 

I'm working on building a classifier for dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions using the HAM10000 dataset. 
If you'd like to take a look at some of the work I've done so far [check out my Notebook!](https://github.com/florestony54/skin-lesion/blob/main/skin_lesion.ipynb)

Another smaller project I'm working on is a brief analysis of prices for the cryptocurrencies Ethereum and Bitcoin. Feel free to check out [the notebook](https://github.com/florestony54/Eth_vs_Btc/blob/main/Eth_vs_Btc.ipynb) if you're interested!

## What am I learning?

I've been quite focused on machine learning, specifically deep learning. What has captured the majority of my interest lately is image classification for Biology/Health Care. 

During my free time I also like to dabble in cybersecurity and ethical hacking concepts, but I definitely have **a ton** to learn. `current_phase = 'baby steps'`

## A few articles I've written
