## Hi there, I'm Tony ðŸ‘‹ 
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-d-flores/) [Medium](https://medium.com/@florestony5454)


I'm a software developer at Dow Chemical as a part of the Analytics Team for Digital Commerce. I have a Masters in Computer Science where my studies were focused on Machine Learning and AI. I studied Biology and Chemistry in undergrad, and I generally love all things Science and Tech! ðŸ§ªðŸ’»

## What am I currently working on?

I'm slowly making small improvements and adding features to my stock market app [StockWatch](https://stockwatchteam12.herokuapp.com/).

I'm also working on starting up a blog focused on AI that I'm really excited to get going!

## What am I learning?

I've been pretty focused on machine learning, specifically deep learning. What has captured the majority of my interest lately is computer vision applications for Biology/Health Care. 

During my free time I also like to dabble in cybersecurity and ethical hacking concepts, but I definitely have **a ton** to learn. `current_phase = 'baby steps'`
